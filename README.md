# Bank Application Using Amazon SageMaker and S3

#### This repository contains an end-to-end machine learning project for predicting the effectiveness of a bank's marketing campaign. The project leverages Amazon SageMaker for model training, deployment, and prediction, and AWS S3 for storing and managing datasets. The model is built using XGBoost, one of the most efficient machine learning algorithms for classification problems.

## Project Highlights
### 1. Dataset: 
* The dataset contains information about a bank's telemarketing campaign and includes features like customer demographics, contact details, and campaign outcomes.
* Dataset source: https://d1.awsstatic.com/tmt/build-train-deploy-machine-learning-model-sagemaker/bank_clean.27f01fbbdf43271788427f3682996ae29ceca05d.csv
